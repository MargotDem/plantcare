The goal of this mini-app is to build a basic plant-watering reminding app

One should be able to add one's houseplants in the app and add how frequently it should be watered (eg: every 6 days), and then see a list of all the plants that are due to be watered. Upon watering the plant, one can check off the plant in the list, and the app registers the next "due to be watered" date in X days in the future (X being the watering frequency).
One should be able to add users and switch between users, add plants to each user, and add another user to a certain plant for plant responsiblity co-sharing.
(in a future version of the app, each user should be able to log in separately of course)

This mini-app should allow:

BREAD operations on users:
browse users
read a user's info
edit a user's info
add a user
delete a user

BREAD operations on plants:
browse plants
read a plant's info
edit a plant's info
add a plant
delete a plant

add another user to a plant

see the watering planning view:
see which plants are overdue, which plants are due today and in the future
be able to check off plants when they were watered
